# Secret Keys

This project depends on Stripes API and Twillio's SendGrid. 
Stripe is used for the transactions and Security. SendGrid is used for user contact.
Both are free at a basic tier, which is perfect for our needs.

You may also add an _optional_ Facebook Pixel ID. 

- Dev: At the most basic level you should just need in enter your own develpment keys in a `.local.env` file. 
Restart your server and you should be in a test mode.

##### .local.env

```
PUBLISHABLE_KEY=stripe_publishable_key
SECRET_KEY=stripe_secret_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FACEBOOK_PIXEL_ID=
SENDGRID_API_KEY=
```
