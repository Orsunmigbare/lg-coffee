# lg-coffee

The quickest way bootstrap an Ecommerce application without hosting fees.

## Getting Started

Before we begin lets talk about the **prerequisites** required to get up and running with lg-coffee. 

  - [ ] Stripe Account
  - [ ] Vercel Account (preferred domain hosting)

### Quick Setup

Initilaze a new project from within your terminal. 

```
$ npx lg-init myAwesomeStore
```

From here you will be promted to navigate to your new directoy. Install the dependencies _(npm preferred)_ 
and run the local dev server.

```bash
$ cd myAwesomeStore
$ npm i 
```

##### Rename your `example.env` to `.env.local`

This is where we will import our TEST KEYS from stripe. 
_(We will use our production keys a bit later, but for now just know we won't 
ever use them in any public repo.)_

Now we should be good to start the local server.
If you've already started the server, you will need to restart 
it for these changes to take effect.

```
$ npm run dev
```

Navigate to the <a href="http://localhost:3000" target="_blank">http://localhost:3000</a> 
running from your terminal and you should be greated with the demo storefront. 

## Personalizing your Store Front

Let's navigate to our `/utils/data.js` file. If you are familiar with Objects, 
this file should be relatively straightforward. 
If you are green to coding then fear not, we've got you covered. 
This is the base object where all of our store details and products info will live. 
It's imported through the backend of our application and sent forward.

- _Static Assests come from the `public/` directory. Any time we reference a static assest we can assume they will be avaible via _`/myImportedAsset.png`.

##### Example `data.js` file

```
exports.data = {
  store: {
    name: 'myAwesomeStore',
    logo: '/logo.png',
    url: https://www.myawesomestore.com/,
    description: 'Clothing shop',
    contact: '6matbub@gmail.com',
    info: {
      faq: [
        {
          q: 'Do you sell products?',
          a: 'Yes',
        },       
      ],
      about: `
        This is my Awesome Stores descripton to be used in SEO.
      `,
    },
    social: {
      facebook: 'https://www.facebook.com/',
      twitter: 'https://www.twitter.com/',
      instagram: 'https://www.instagram.com/',
    },
  },
  products: {
    heading: 'New Arrivials',
    products: [
      {
        name: 'Awesome Product',
        description: 'If I had an awesome product to sell, this is probably where i\'d sell it at.',        
        price: 287, 
        sku: 'abc123',
        images: [
          '/path_to_img_1.png',
          '/path_to_img_2.png',
          '/path_to_img_3.png',
        ],
        type: 'clothing',        
        qty: 50,
      },
          {
        name: 'New Product',
        description: 'If I had an awesome product to sell, this is probably where i\'d sell it at.',        
        price: 546, 
        sku: 'efg456',
        images: [
          '/path_to_img_1.png',
          '/path_to_img_2.png',
          '/path_to_img_3.png',
        ],
        type: 'clothing',        
        qty: 50,
      },
    ],
  },
};

```

_dont forget to run_ `npm run dev` _while editing your storefront to see live changes_

## Custom Styling

We are using bootstrap and css to style this webpage. The easiest way to identfy different elements and 
experiement with new styles would be via dev tools in your browser.

## Adding Addition pages

This project was bootstrapped itself using next.js as it's framework. 
Additional pages are automatically added by creating a new file in your `pages/` directory.

```
myAwesomeProject
├── otherContent
└── pages
    ├── api/
    ├── checkout/
    ├── _app.jsx
    ├── index.jsx
    └── your-page.jsx
```

For more information on adding additional pages checkout the <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages" target="_blank">Offical Next.js Documentation</a>

## Facebook Pixel


Dev Mode: 
- Referring to your `.env.local` add the following line followed by your Pixel ID and restart your server
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FACEBOOK_PIXEL_ID=YOUR_PIXEL_ID_GOES_HERE
```

## Publishing your Store to Vercel

_Note: We will be using GitHub in junction with Vercel for this step._
